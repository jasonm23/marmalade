== Running Marmalade documentation ==

Here is some stuff Nic uses to manage the node.js/mongodb marmalade instance.


=== Mongo maintenance ===

mongodb is so lolsome.

Here's just a few tips.


==== updating the package owner ====

Find the new owner's marmalade email address:

{{{
use marmalade
db.user.findOne({"_name": "username"})
}}}

shows the email address in the structure.

Then find the package:

{{{
use marmalade
db.packages.findOne({"_name": "package-name"})
}}}

Check the existing owner. You'll probably want to send them an email
explaining the change of ownership.

Now update the package:

{{{
use marmalade
db.packages.update({"_name": "package-name"}, { $set: { "owners": { "username": "email-address" } } })
}}}

Now update the user's package ownership list:

{{{
use marmalade
db.users.update({"_name": "username"}, { $push : { "packages": "package-name" } } )
}}}


== FAQ ==

=== API tokens? how do I change them? ===

there seems to be a bug about changing API tokens.  The API token is
stored in the db attached to the user.  It's constructed when the user
registers and then never changed.
